There are a lot of moving parts in `eksctl`. Here’s a list of common issues we’ve seen customers run into:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error while deleting "1 pods are unevictable from node ip"'>

    This error happens when deleting the cluster and some pods in `kube-system` refuse to stop.
    To fix this run the following command and the deletion process should be able to proceed.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o NAME | xargs kubectl -n kube-system delete
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Error while deleting "cleaning up AWS load balancers created by Kubernetes objects of Kind Service or Ingress"'>
    This happens when the cluster doesn't properly delete load balancers, to fix this

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Get load balancers to be deleted">
    Run this to get the available load balancers
    ```sh
    kubectl get ingress
