## Docker Compose

The Docker Compose self hosted option is the easiest way to get started self hosting Trieve.

Things you need

- Domain name
- System with at least 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM (excluding the cpu embedding servers)
- System with at least 4 CPU cores and >25GB of RAM (including the cpu embedding servers)

### Install Docker

```bash
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Clone Trieve repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve
cd trieve
```

### Create `.env` file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### Start Trieve Services

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Start Embedding servers

We offer 2 docker-compose files for embedding servers. One for GPU and one for CPU.

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu-embeddings.yml up -d
```

or

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-gpu-embeddings.yml up -d
```

\* Note on embedding servers. If you want to use a separate GPU enabled device for embedding servers you will need to update the following parameters

```sh
SPARSE_SERVER_QUERY_ORIGIN
SPARSE_SERVER_DOC_ORIGIN
EMBEDDING_SERVER_ORIGIN
SPARSE_SERVER_QUERY_ORIGIN
```

### Setup Caddy reverse proxy

Install Caddy

Edit the Caddyfile

```sh
nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Add the following configuration

```Caddyfile
dashboard.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:5173
}

chat.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:5175
}

search.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:5174
}

api.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8090
}

auth.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Start Caddy, you may also need to reload the service

```sh
sudo systemctl reload caddy.service
```

### Set the following A records for your domain to point to the server IP address.

```
A dashboard.yourdomain.com your-server-ip
A chat.yourdomain.com your-server-ip
A search.yourdomain.com your-server-ip
A auth.yourdomain.com your-server-ip
A api.yourdomain.com your-server-ip
```

### Edit .env

Most values can be left as default, the ones you do need to edit are

```
KC_HOSTNAME="auth.yourdomain.com"
KC_PROXY=edge

VITE_API_HOST=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
VITE_SEARCH_UI_URL=https://search.yourdomain.com
VITE_CHAT_UI_URL=https://chat.yourdomain.com
VITE_ANALYTICS_UI_URL=https://analytics.yourdomain.com
VITE_DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.yourdomain.com

OIDC_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL="https://auth.yourdomain.com/realms/trieve/protocol/openid-connect/auth"
OIDC_ISSUER_URL="https://auth.yourdomain.com/realms/trieve"
BASE_SERVER_URL="https://api.yourdomain.com"
```

### Authorize keycloak redirect URLs

Go to auth.yourdomain.com and login with the default credentials (user: admin password: aintsecure)

1. Change the Realm from master to trieve
2. Go to Clients -> vault -> Settings
3. Add the following to the Valid Redirect URIs and Valid Post Logout Redirect URIs

```
https://api.yourdomain.com/*
https://dashboard.yourdomain.com/*
https://chat.yourdomain.com/*
https://search.yourdomain.com/*
```

### Testing

The fastest way to test is using the Trieve CLI

```
trieve login # Make sure to set the api url to http://localhost:8090
trieve dataset example
```

And there you have it. Your very own Trieve stack.
Happy hacking ðŸš€
