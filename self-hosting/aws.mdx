# Installing Trieve on AWS (EKS)

Things you need

- Domain name
- An allowance for at least 8vCPU for G and VT instances
- helm cli
- aws cli
- kubectl
- k9s (optional)

## Clone the Trieve repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve.git
cd trieve
```

## Login to AWS

```sh
aws configure
```

## Provision Terraform

aws should be configured with your IAM credentails chosen. Run the following commands to create the EKS cluster

```sh
cd terraform/aws
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Login to the cluster

Set up your kubeconfig to point to the new cluster

```sh
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-2 --name trieve-aws-cluster
```

## Install Trieve Depenedencies

Trieve depends on the following:
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) (or some other oidc compliant Auth Provider)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) We are using RDS for this.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) We are using Elasticache
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) We are using clickhouse-operator
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) We are using qdrant-operator

### Ingress nginx + Cert Manager (optional)

Ingress-nginx + Cert manager is how we will expose the trieve services to the internet. 
Feel free to use whatever ingress controller you are comfortable with.

<Note>
For this guide we will be using ingress-nginx and cert-manager only for the keycloak installation.
</Note>

```sh

# To install ingress-nginx
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.12.0-beta.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
# To install cert-manager
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.2/cert-manager.yaml
# To install ClusterIssuer for keycloak
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/keycloak-extras/cluster-issuer.yaml
```


### Clickhouse

First install the clickhouse operator and clickhouse installation.

Note that this has a preconfigured password and user. We will use these in the helm chart.
They will need to be changed in a production environment according to your password policy.

```sh

kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/clickhouse/
# Apply twice to ensure crds are installed
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/clickhouse/

```

Check the status of the clickhouse installation.

```sh

kubectl get ClickhouseInstallations

```

```
NAME                CLUSTERS   HOSTS   STATUS      HOSTS-COMPLETED   AGE
trieve-clickhouse   1          1       Completed                     3m3s
```

### OIDC Compliant server (Keycloak)

This is an example of installing keycloak on GCP. You can use any other OIDC compliant provider.
Note that this is using postgresql as a statefulset with a prefilled username/password, you can use a managed service like CloudSQL or CloudNativePG.
For higher security.

This also includes a KeycloakRealm that contains the recommended default settings for a keycloak realm. This also has a prefilled clientSecret which
should be rotated post installation.

```sh
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/keycloak/
# Apply twice to ensure crds are installed
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/keycloak/
```

```sh
kubectl get sts trieve-keycloak
```

### Qdrant helm chart

<Note>
For Qdrant we recommend you install it via helm chart, with these values.yaml.
Note that this is for a qdrant cluster with 3 nodes and 10 GB ram per node.
</Note>

Each node also has qdrant-node taint on it, so that the trieve pods can be scheduled on the same nodes types

Note that `apiKey` is also preset to `qdrant-api-key`, this may need to be changed if you plan on enabling 
qdrant ingress.

```yaml
helm repo add qdrant https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant-helm
helm repo update
helm upgrade -i qdrant qdrant/qdrant -f helm/test-production/qdrant-values.yaml
```

Verify Qdrant is installed

```sh
kubectl get sts qdrant
```

```
NAME     READY   AGE
qdrant   3/3     54s
```

### Redis

For simplicity, we are using Elasticache. This was configured in the terraform script. You can view the ip using

```sh
cd terraform/aws
terraform output
```

set values in the `helm/values.aws.yaml` file

```yaml

config:
  redis:
    uri: redis://<your-redis-uri>

```

### Postgresql (via RDS)

You can get your RDS connection string using the following command

```sh
cd terraform/aws
terraform output
```

Be sure to update your postgresql URI `helm/values.aws.yaml` with the correct connection string if you modified the default values

```yaml
postgres:
  dbURI: "postgres://postgres:password@cloud-sql:5432/postgres"
```

## Install Trieve

### Modify domain names for ingresses

```yaml
domains:
  dashboard:
    host: dashboard.trieve.ai
    class: alb
  server:
    host: api.trieve.ai
    class: alb
  search:
    host: search.trieve.ai
    class: alb
  chat:
    host: chat.trieve.ai
    class: gce
```


Install the helm chart

```sh

helm upgrade -i -f helm/values.aws.yaml trieve-aws helm/

```

### Verify the installation

After installing, `kubectl get deployments` should look like this.

```
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
bktree-worker       1/1     1            1           14m
chat                1/1     1            1           14m
crawl-worker        1/1     1            1           14m
dashboard           1/1     1            1           14m
delete-worker       1/1     1            1           14m
group-worker        1/1     1            1           14m
ingest              10/10   10           10          14m
keycloak-operator   1/1     1            1           46m
redis               1/1     1            1           46m
search              1/1     1            1           14m
server              3/3     1            0           14m
sync-qdrant         0/0     0            0           14m
word-worker         1/1     1            1           14m
```

### Set Ingress

#### Get Ingress ip address

```sh

kubectl get ingress

```

You will get an output like this:

```sh
ingress-chat                alb    chat.yourdomain.com        4.157.193.10   80, 443   7m43s
ingress-dashboard           alb    dashboard.yourdomain.com   4.157.193.10   80, 443   7m43s
ingress-keycloak            alb    auth.yourdomain.com        4.157.193.10   80, 443   20m
ingress-search              alb    search.yourdomain.com      4.157.193.10   80, 443   7m43s
ingress-server              alb    api.yourdomain.com         4.157.193.10   80, 443   7m43s
```

#### Add A records

Add A records to your domain registrar with the IP address of the ingress.

```
chat.yourdomain.com      -> 4.157.193.10 # Example IP
dashboard.yourdomain.com -> 4.157.193.10 # Example IP
search.yourdomain.com    -> 4.157.193.10 # Example IP
api.yourdomain.com       -> 4.157.193.10 # Example IP
```

You will also need to update any other references to that domain name in the `helm/values.aws.yaml` file.

Ensure you run `helm upgrade -i -f helm/values.aws.yaml trieve-aws helm/` after making changes. to apply them.
