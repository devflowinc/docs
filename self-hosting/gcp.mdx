## GCP GKE

Things you need

- Domain name
- helm cli
- google cloud cli
- kubectl
- k9s (optional)

### 0. Clone the Trieve repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve.git
cd trieve
```


### 1. Authenticate with GCP

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

### 2. Provision Terraform

aws should be configured with your IAM credentails chosen. Run the following commands to create the EKS cluster

Copy the default `vars.tfvars.example` file and fill in the values

```
cp terraform/gcloud/vars.tfvars.example terraform/gcloud/vars.tfvars
```

You will need to add your google cloud project id. You can also change the cluster and node types as needed

```vars.tfvars
project = "***********-*******-******"
cluster_name = "trievegcp"
region = "us-west2"
zone = "us-west2-a"
```

```sh
cd terraform/gcloud
terraform init
terraform apply -var vars.tfvars
```

This should provision a GKE cluster, Elasticache instance, and a CloudSQL instance.

### Login to the cluster

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region us-east1-b trievegcp
```

### Install Other Trieve Depenedencies

Trieve depends on the following:
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) (or some other oidc compliant Auth Provider)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) We are using CloudSQL
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) We are using Elasticache
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) We are using clickhouse-operator
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) We are using qdrant-operator

#### Clickhouse


First install the clickhouse operator and clickhouse installation.

Note that this has a preconfigured password and user. We will use these in the helm chart.
They will need to be changed in a production environment according to your password policy.

```sh

kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/clickhouse/
# Apply twice to ensure crds are installed
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/clickhouse/

```

Check the status of the clickhouse installation.

```sh

kubectl get ClickhouseInstallations

```

```
NAME                CLUSTERS   HOSTS   STATUS      HOSTS-COMPLETED   AGE
trieve-clickhouse   1          1       Completed                     3m3s
```

#### OIDC Compliant server (keycloak)

This is an example of installing keycloak on GCP. You can use any other OIDC compliant provider.
Note that this is using postgresql as a statefulset with a prefilled username/password, you can use a managed service like CloudSQL or CloudNativePG.
For higher security.

This also includes a KeycloakRealm that contains the recommended default settings for a keycloak realm. This also has a prefilled clientSecret which
should be rotated post installation.

```sh
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/keycloak/
# Apply twice to ensure crds are installed
kubectl apply -f helm/test-production/keycloak/
```

```sh
kubectl get sts trieve-keycloak
```

#### Qdrant

For qdrnat we reccomend you install it via helm chart, with these values.yaml.
Note that this is for a qdrant cluster with 3 nodes and GB ram per node.

Each node also has qdrant-node taint on it, so that the trieve pods can be scheduled on the same nodes types

Note that `apiKey` is also preset to `qdrant-api-key`, this may need to be changed if you plan on enabling 
qdrant ingress.

```yaml

helm repo add qdrant https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant-helm
helm repo update
helm upgrade -i qdrant qdrant/qdrant -f helm/test-production/qdrant-values.yaml

```

Verify Qdrant is installed

```sh
kubectl get sts qdrant
```

```
NAME     READY   AGE
qdrant   3/3     54s
```

You may need to update `helm/values.gcp.yaml` with a new qdrant apiKey

```yaml
...
config:
...
  qdrant:
...
    apiKey: qdrant-api-key
...
```

#### Redis

For simplicity, we are using Elasticache. This was configured in the terraform script. You can view the ip using

```sh

cd terraform/gcloud
terraform output redis_host

```

set values in the `helm/values.gcp.yaml` file

```yaml

config:
  redis:
    uri: redis://<your-redis-uri>

```

### Install Trieve

#### Modify domain names for ingresses

```yaml
domains:
  dashboard:
    host: dashboard.trieve.ai
    class: gce
  server:
    host: api.trieve.ai
    class: gce
  search:
    host: search.trieve.ai
    class: gce
  chat:
    host: chat.trieve.ai
    class: gce
```

### Setup postgresql connection with cloudsql proxy

First install cloudsql proxy

```yaml

kubectl apply -f ./helm/test-production/cloud-sql-proxy.yaml

```

Be sure to update `helm/values.gcp.yaml` with the correct connection string if you modified the default values

```yaml
postgres:
  dbURI: "postgres://postgres:password@cloud-sql:5432/postgres"
```

Install the helm chart

```sh

helm upgrade -i -f helm/values.gcp.yaml trieve-gcp helm/

```

### Verify the installation

After installing, `kubectl get deployments` should look like this.

```
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
bktree-worker       1/1     1            1           14m
chat                1/1     1            1           14m
crawl-worker        1/1     1            1           14m
dashboard           1/1     1            1           14m
delete-worker       1/1     1            1           14m
group-worker        1/1     1            1           14m
ingest              10/10   10           10          14m
keycloak-operator   1/1     1            1           46m
redis               1/1     1            1           46m
search              1/1     1            1           14m
server              0/3     1            0           14m
sync-qdrant         0/0     0            0           14m
word-worker         1/1     1            1           14m
```

### Setting your Ingress

Run `kubectl get ingress` to get the ip address of the ingress points.
You will need to add an A record for each of them accouding to your `domains:` as defined
in your `helm/values.gcp.yaml` file.

You will also need to update any other references to that domain name in the `helm/values.gcp.yaml` file.

Ensure you run `helm upgrade -i -f helm/values.gcp.yaml trieve-gcp helm/` after making changes. to apply them.
