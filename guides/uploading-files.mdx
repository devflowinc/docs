## Overview

We provide the ability for users to upload their files to Trieve and use our automatic large language vision model chunking. When uploading a file to Trieve, we automatically group the chunks together to link them. This is done through our [upload file route](/api-reference/file/upload-file).

## Uploading a File to Trieve

Our service supports various file types (e.g., HTML, DOCX, PDF). We use Apache Tika to convert these files to HTML to preserve formatting and then chunk them.

### Important Parameters

- **`base64_file`**: To allow users to pass metadata with their file uploads, we require files to be base64 URL encoded. Convert `+` to `-`, `/` to `_`, and remove the ending `=` if present.
- **`file_name`**: The name of the file being uploaded, including the extension. This will become the name of the resulting group.
- **`group_tracking_id`**: This field allows you to assign an arbitrary ID to the group, aiding in coordination with your database system. You can search for this group using this ID.
- **`link`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp`**: These fields are indexed to enable fast filtering of groups based on these attributes.
- **`metadata`**: This field allows you to include any arbitrary metadata in the form of a JSON object with the group.

<Note>
 For the best filtering performance, we recommend using the `link`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp` fields, as there are dedicated indexes for these. The metadata field has an index built for match queries but is not optimized for range queries.

Whenever you make a request to the Trieve API, you need to include the `TR-Dataset` header with your dataset ID and the `Authorization` header with your API key.
