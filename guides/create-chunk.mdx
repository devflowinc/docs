We provide an easy interface for users to upload their chunks individually so that users should have control over how they chunk their data

## Uploading Individual Chunks to Trieve

The main route that we expose to handle this functionality is our [create chunk route](/api-reference/chunk/create-or-upsert-chunk-or-chunks).

### Important Parameters

- **`chunk_html`**: This is the content that will be embedded and made searchable. You can pass HTML here, and our service will automatically clean it for the embeddings.
- **`chunk_vector`**: This allows you to provide your own pre-calculated embeddings. Use this if you have already calculated embeddings for your dataset and want to migrate them to Trieve.
- **`group_ids` and `group_tracking_ids`**: These fields let you specify a group to associate the chunks with, useful for linking multiple chunks from one document.
- **`link`, `location`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp`**: These fields are indexed to enable fast filtering of chunks based on these attributes.
- **`metadata`**: This field allows you to include any arbitrary metadata in the form of a JSON object with the chunk. 
<Note>
For the best filtering performance, we recommend using the `link`, `location`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp` rather than the metadata field as there are dedicated indexes for these. The metadata has an index built on it, but it is only optimized for match queries
</Note>
- **`tracking_id`**: This field allows you to assign an arbitrary ID to the chunk, aiding in coordination with your database system. You can search for chunks using this ID.
- **`weight`**: This field allows you to assign a weight to the chunks, which can influence the chunk's ranking within search results. This is similar to merchandising features on other platforms.

### Formatting chunk_html

Creating a good `chunk_html` is crucial for the quality of your search results. Here are some tips to help you create a good `chunk_html`:

- **Include all relevant information**: Make sure to include all the information that you want to be searchable in the `chunk_html`.
- **Use newlines**: Put semantically distinct information on separate lines to help the model understand the structure of the text and search quality for each field better
- **Label each field**: If you have multiple fields in your `chunk_html`, label each field with a header to help the model better embed the text and improve search quality.

Example of a good `chunk_html`:

## Example Create Chunk Request

Whenever you make a request to the Trieve API, you need to include the `TR-Dataset` header with your dataset ID and the `Authorization` header with your API key.
</Note>

```json
