## Using the React Component

The React Component is the easiest way to get started with Trieve SiteSearch.
It is a fully featured search component that can be added to any React application.

Here is an example of how to use the React Component:

```jsx
import { TrieveModalSearch, TrieveSDK } from 'trieve-search-component'
import 'trieve-search-component/dist/index.css'

const SearchButton = () => {

    return )
        <TrieveModalSearch
            apiKey="tr-1234567890abcdef"
            datasetId="********-****-****-****-************"
            defaultSearchQueries=[
                "cancer",
                "heart disease",
                "diabetes"
             ]
            defaultAiQuestions=[
                "What is cancer?",
                "What is heart disease?",
                "What is diabetes?"
            ]
            debounceMs={100}
            brandColor="Trieve"
            brandColor="#E75536"
        />
```

This is the simplest way to get started with Trieve SiteSearch. You can customize the component further by passing in additional props.

For more props and customization options, see [Parameters](/site-search/parameters).
