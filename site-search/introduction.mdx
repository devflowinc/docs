Trieve Sitesearch is a powerful search component that allows you to add search functionality to your website in minutes.
It is a fully customizable search component that can be added to any website, regardless of the technology stack.

It integrates seemlessly with [Trieve](https://trieve.ai), which has a site scraper and indexer for any website, docs or blog that you want to search.
