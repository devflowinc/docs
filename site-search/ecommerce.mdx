## How to use Trieve SiteSearch for Ecommerce Storefronts

<Note>
  Conveniently, most Shopify stores have a `products.json` file available at
  `https://foostoreurl.com/products.json` that contains all the product data for
  Google and other search engines to index. You can see an example at
  [https://ridge.com/products.json](https://ridge.com/products.json). Trieve
  takes advantage of this to scrape your store.

### 5. Add a tab message with code

Once you have configured the search component, scroll to the bottom and go to the "Tab Message" section and add a tag with a code snippet to get the code you will put into the script tag to add the component to your site.

### 8. Test and add the script tag to your site

We like to use the [tampermonkey browswer extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to test the script tag before adding it to our site. Once you have tested the script tag, add it to your site's head tag in your HTML.

Here are some common guides for adding a script tag to common platforms:
