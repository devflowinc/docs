Search and RAG are powerful primitives, but can take months to implement and deploy in production. Trieve abstracts away the complexity of these tasks, allowing you to focus on building your product.

With Trieve, you can build and deploy a ChatGPT like experience or a search engine on your data in a matter of hours.
